    <h2>SPAM ANALYSIS</h2>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <p>In this system, to solve the problem of spam, the spam classification system is created to identify spam and non spam.
Since spammers may send spam messages many times, it is difficult to identify it every time manually .
So we will be using some of the strategies in our proposed to detect the spam. The proposed solution not only identifies the spam word but also identifies the IP address of the system.
 The spam messages is sent so that the next time when the spam message is sent from the same system our proposed system directly identifies it as blacklisted based on the IP address.
